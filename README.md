# Type|Forty Productions Discord Bot Platform
## Formerly Magic: The Gathering API Interface v1

## Description

   Originally only used to search for Magic the Gathering card information through CLI, the app has evolved to encompass more than it's original parts. Therefore, the decision has been made by administration (Myself) to rebase this project and rename it to the Type Forty Discord Bot Platform, Which hopes to be another step in my coding journey as I re-learn API interactions and at the least data retrieval and entry bringing together multiple modules.

   Right now, the bot contains a number of commands, a listing of which is:

   - /gpt_prompt: This allows conversation with the ChatGPT AI API for natural language conversation
   - /scry: A discord version of the MTG App v1 CLI application, currently pulls information from the MTG API
   - /ping: basic that replies with "Ping!"
   - /user: provides information about user
   - /options-info: Information on the various options? This is an example and will likely be removed in the future

   Please feel free to use this app for your own Discord server, but be advised you need to set up your own config.json file with API Keys before use. Though I may hopefully find a way that this will ask for/use yours during set up if I decide to build an auto-installer

## Contributions

   Use Pull Requests to implement new features, Each Feature should have it's own Branch (eg. GPTAI Integration was done within a "gptintegrate" branch and then submitted for a Pull Request before being merged into the main branch) and in the words of Wil Wheaton: 
   don't be a dick
