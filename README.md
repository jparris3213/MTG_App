# Magic: The Gathering API Interface v1

## Description
  This CLI Application is currentlly designed to search the MTG API using the mtgsdk module provided by Wizards of the Coast. While the application contained within the App itself is coded by me, any data from WOTC is 100% owned by WOTC and this is not an attempt to copy/steal or otherwise break copyright of WOTCs Intellectual Property. If anything, this is more a personal excercise than outright Application
